                <p>I have spent 28 years in the field of manufacturing. The vast majority of experience was earned being a contractor at some really great facilities. I hope to bring my diverse experience to your shop.  </p>
                <p>I also have a wide variety of IT skills related to manufacturing. Including normal desktop and network administration but also including data capture, edge, and other IoT devices.</p>
                <p>Currently, in addition to freelance work, I manage a small local CNC machine shop, take care of the email and local network, and work on future developments in the VR space.</p>
